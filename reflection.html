	<h3>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h3>

	<p> Responsive design is a graphic user interface (GUI) design strategy for creating information that adapts to
		different screen sizes without losing its quality. Designers use relative units (percentages) and media queries
		to guarantee that their designs adjust to the browser space and maintain content uniformity across devices.
		It employs so-called breakpoints to govern how a site's layout will appear: one design is applied above a
		breakpoint, while another is applied below it. Breakpoints are frequently determined by the browser's width.

	<h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>

	<p> Responsive design relate to web technologies in many ways one of which is: Flexible grids and layouts,
		pictures, and judicious use of CSS media queries are all part of the process. When a user transitions from a
		laptop to an phone, the website should adapt to the new device's resolution, picture size, and scripting
		capabilities. The user's device settings may also need to be considered; for example, if the user has a VPN
		for there device on their phone, the website should not limit the user's access to the page. In other words,
		the website should be equipped with technology that allows it to respond to the user's choices automatically.
		This would eliminate the need for each new item on the market to go through a separate design and development
		phase.

	<h3>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h3>

	<p> I learned a lot of things during this assignment like what are the difference between building web application
		for different devices through my research like they have to be user responsive, compile with web technologies,
		easy to navigate, and most importantly they should be of responsive design. As if one user shifts from one
		screen to another there could be a size difference and to eliminate the changes of web size exceeding the user
		screen
		it should adjust itself with the size of device to countinue with easy experience.
	</p>

	<h3>Finally,describe your learning experience in the course.</h3>

	<p> During this whole course (WEB222) i learned a lot about websites and the amount of efforts it takes to create
		one user friendly website. I learned how to use the tags in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In HTML I learned how to make
		a
		base for website and also got to know that all the real work is done in JavaScript that all the code that make a
		web site easy to use goes in JS. In making a Site user friendly not only JavaScriptand HTML places a role a
		greate role is
		also played by CSS as it is the one file in which a web develpor writes the code to make it easy to navigate and
		easy to use.
		<br>
		Lastly I would like to thanks my Prof. Dr. Tanvir Alam that his notes and his classes played a huge role
		in making this course easy and completing this assignment.
